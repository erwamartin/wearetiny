Data visualization for Solar System which playfully shows the orders of magnitude in space. A project developed with eyes fixed on the stars.


## Context
We Are Tiny is a school project for HETIC created by third-year students. We do not claim to be experts in astrophysics, so please feel free to contact us at contact@wearetiny.io if you want more information about our calculations or if you think some data is wrong.

## Calculation & data quirks

### Solar System
Initial position of the planet is an approximate calculation based on the position of the planets on 01/01/2014. The end the Solar System is fixed at the Heliopause.

### Speeds of the spaceships
Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo: 4000 km/h
Voyager 2 : 56000 km/h
Solar Probe Plus (expected 2018): 720000 km/h

### Single Planet
Planet Calendar: Day 0 for planets days is 01/01/2014. We used this d3.js script to make it: http://bl.ocks.org/clayzermk1/9142407

### Planet Comparison
No of missions for Earth is the number of missions for the Moon


## Tech
Wearetiny uses open source projects to work properly:

* [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) - Give your JS App some Backbone with Models, Views, Collections, and Events
* [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) - Data-Driven Documents
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Write Less, Do More
